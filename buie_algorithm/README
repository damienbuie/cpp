/*
 * The code simply generates the spatial, spectral and position of the sun 
 * for any location. The spectral simulation is perhaps outdated for the 
 * normalisation of CPV data and should be replaced by Chris Gueymard's 
 * Smarts2 (I would have included it but I am unsure of the licence). 
 *
 * The code is currently being used by Emcore, CSIRO, AUSRA Energy and
 * Spectrolab to my knowledge. It can be used to get sub-millimeter 
 * resolution in the imaging place (both spectrally and spatially) for 
 * concentrations in excess of 1000X under dispersive media. 
 * 
 * Please read the section on the warranty
 *
 * To compile 
 * g++ -Iinclude test.cpp -o test 
 * ./test
 * 
 * that will give an example of the core elements and come april it will
 * documented for a presentation I am giving in Italy.
 * 
 * Regards
 * Damien
